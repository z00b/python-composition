# Python Composition

A set of files I used in the tutorial of (roughly) the same name at the
SF Python Meetup Project Night on 2014-09-17.

Unfortunately if you didn't attend, these probably don't stand on their own, but
ping me if you have interest or questions.

## Topics Covered

* list comprehensions
* generator expressions and generators
* context managers
* decorators
